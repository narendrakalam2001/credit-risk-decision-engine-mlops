Production-grade end-to-end machine learning system for **personal loan risk assessment** with
a **3-tier decision engine (APPROVE / REVIEW / DECLINE)**, probability calibration, SHAP explainability,
Champion vs Challenger system, and real-time API + monitoring dashboard.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a complete **Fintech-grade Credit Risk System** with:

* Automated ML training pipeline (13 models, hyperparameter tuning)
* Rich feature engineering — 12 engineered features (debt ratios, digital engagement, income interactions)
* SMOTENC for class imbalance (handles mixed feature types — binary + continuous)
* Dual ColumnTransformer — scaled preprocessor for linear models, unscaled for tree models
* Probability calibration (holdout isotonic regression)
* 3-tier risk decision engine with hard + soft business rules
* Champion vs Challenger model promotion system (3 promotion gates)
* SHAP explainability (TreeExplainer)
* MLflow experiment tracking
* PSI drift monitoring
* Leakage detection before training
* 25 pytest unit tests with coverage report
* Real-time FastAPI + Applicant Simulator
* Streamlit monitoring dashboard with real-time alerts

---

## 💡 Why This Project Matters

Traditional credit scoring systems lack transparency and adaptability.
This system combines ML + business rules + monitoring to simulate
real-world banking decision pipelines.

## 🎯 Risk Decision Engine

Unlike simple fraud detection (BLOCK / APPROVE), this system uses a
**3-tier fintech decision engine**:

| Decision | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| `APPROVE` | Low risk probability + no rule flags |
| `REVIEW`  | Borderline ML score OR soft rule (low income / large family) |
| `DECLINE` | High risk probability OR hard rule (extreme mortgage/income ratio) |

Rules are checked **before** ML — matching real bank underwriting systems.

---

## 🏆 Champion vs Challenger System

Every new training run is compared against the production champion using 3 promotion gates:

| Gate | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| F1 Improvement | Challenger must beat champion by ≥ 0.5% |
| ROC-AUC | Challenger must have ROC-AUC ≥ 0.95 |
| Generalization Gap | Train-test gap must be ≤ 10% |

Results logged to `risk_models/challenger_log.json` and visible in dashboard.
